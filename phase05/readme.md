# Salamander README

For this program to work you will need to create and fill in a file named **private/db_credentials.php** using the following guideline:

```
<?php

define("DB_SERVER", "server name");
define("DB_USER", "username");
define("DB_PASS", "password");
define("DB_NAME", "database name");

?>
```

You will also need to download the **salamanders.sql** file and run the code.
